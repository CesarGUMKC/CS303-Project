//  
   I chose example 4 on the Project document, Implement a Program that uses a stack to check an expressions balance. I added three functionalities; convert any Infix expression to Post/Pre-Fix, convert any Prefix to In/Post-Fix, and convert any PostFix to In/Pre-Fix    //   Source Code is included in GitHub and I have no DataSet for this program   // I was able to start a GUI for the program, but was unable to make it functional. The biggest hurdle was the inability to use my string functions on System::string^ inputs. My implementation and three additional functionalities were operational on the program, but could not get the graphic user interface running.
